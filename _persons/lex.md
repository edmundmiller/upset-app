My research is on data visualization methods for domain experts. I design, build, and study interactive visual data analysis solutions that aid researchers in data driven fields, such as biology and medicine, in understanding and communicating complex data sets.

## Bio

I am an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute and the School of Computing at the University of Utah. I direct the Visualization Design Lab where we develop visualization methods and systems to help solve today’s scientific problems.

Before joining the University of Utah, I was a lecturer and post-doctoral visualization researcher at Harvard University. I received my PhD, master’s, and undergraduate degrees from Graz University of Technology. In 2011 I was a visiting researcher at Harvard Medical School.

I am the recipient of an NSF CAREER award and multiple best paper awards or honorable mentions at IEEE VIS, ACM CHI, and other conferences. I also received a best dissertation award from my alma mater. I co-founded [Datavisyn](http://datavisyn.io), a startup company developing visual analytics solutions for the pharmaceutical industry. In addition to writing papers, our lab publishes a lot of visualization software. My most popular tool is [UpSet, a set visualization technique](http://upset.app/). You can find other visualization software on our [GitHub Page](https://github.com/visdesignlab).

## News

I'm on sabbatical for the 2021/2022 academic year, going back to my native Austria to work for [datavisyn](datavisyn.io), the company I co-founded, and working with [Marc Streit and his group](https://jku-vds-lab.at/) at [Johannes Kepler University](https://www.jku.at/).

Because of my sabbatical **I'm currently not taking on students, PostDocs, or service assignments**.
