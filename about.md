# About


UpSet was originally developed at Harvard in 2014 by Alexander Lex, Nils Gehlenborg, Hendrik Strobelt, Romain Vuillemot, and Hanspeter Pfister and [published at IEEE VIS]({site.baseurl}}/publications/2014_infovis_upset/). 

The figure below shows the first ever sketch of UpSet on a whiteboard, drawn around the end of 2013: 

![Original UpSet Whiteboard Sketch]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/upset_whiteboard.jpg)

As you can see, the final desing is fairly close to the very first sketch.
